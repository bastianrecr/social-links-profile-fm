## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build a clean and responsive profile card that includes:

- A user avatar
- The user's name, location, and a short bio
- A list of social media links

In this refactored version, all elements related to the social links card were grouped into a single reusable component, making it easier to integrate into larger projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Modular CSS (structured with BEM methodology)
- Normalize.css
- CSS media queries for responsiveness
- Reusable component structure for scalability

### What I learned

Through this refactor, I improved my understanding of:

- Component-based thinking in HTML/CSS projects
- BEM methodology to improve clarity and reusability
- Structuring code for future scalability
- Creating visually consistent components that can be reused across projects

### Continued development

I plan to continue:

- Enhancing this component for integration into React projects
- Exploring how to use CSS custom properties for theming
- Building a full design system with more reusable components

### Useful resources

- [BEM Methodology](https://getbem.com/)
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/)
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)
